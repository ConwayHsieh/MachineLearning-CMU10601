Voting results were:
32 0
16 16
16 16
0 32
16 16

It seems that the results were either 50/50 split between the hypotheses, or skewed one way or the other. With so many 50/50 splits, it does not seem it would work well for making decisions, but it does seem to do have a total consensus if there is one.

From this, we can tell that List-then-eliminate easily discriminates against extremes with high confidence, but has a hard time making a concrete decision once it enters less well-defined territories.
