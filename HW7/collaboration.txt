Yes, helped guide Shiyuan Zheng through all of the PyTorch tutorials, which I used, including all of the parts we had to change to fit our dataset to the code in the tutorial. Also used the same initial net: resnet18(). Since we both heavily based our code off of the tutorials, our code may not look very different.

(See below policy on “found code”). If you answered ‘yes’, give full details (book & page, URL &location within the page, etc.).
